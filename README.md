**Description:**
Human activity recognition (HAR) has great significance in various fields such as
healthcare, monitoring, robotics, gaming, and sports. It has drawn great attention and
investigations in the pattern recognition field. This project aims to investigate this research topic from various perspectives with multi-modal sensing mechanisms. More specifically, we will apply state-of-the-art technologies to image, depth image, skeleton, and serial sequence data to realize HAR, respectively. To achieve better recognition accuracy, this project will also test the performance of various combinations of modalities through data fusion. Students will learn abundant knowledge and technologies on data science,
including but not limited to data organization, data processing, data visualization, data
representation, and data fusion.
